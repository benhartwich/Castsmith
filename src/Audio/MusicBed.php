/**
 * Opener and outro, attached automatically by the assembly step.
 *
 * Putting jingles into the Auphonic preset would be the obvious option, but it
 * would come at a price: the
 * assembly step calculates chapters and transcript down to the millisecond, and an
 * intro that Auphonic only prepends later would shift the transcript by its length.
 * That is why the assembly step mixes the music itself and shifts chapters and
 * transcript along with it.
 *
 * The sequence: the opener plays — an audio logo with a spoken line —,
 * and while it fades out over three seconds, the voice comes in. Shortly
 * after the last word the outro begins. With music the episode becomes stereo — the voice sits
 * in the centre, the music keeps its width.
 *
 * Between chapters there is, if uploaded, a short musical bridge
 * ("separator") — up to five different ones that rotate in order, so that
 * not every chapter change sounds the same. Done like in a radio feature: the
 * bridge starts shortly after the last word, and the next chapter
 * already begins while it fades out under the voice. Only the
 * chapter pause gets longer for this; chapter and transcript times therefore
 * stay correct on their own. Break tags in the text were not reliably heard by the voice as a cut
 * (the host, 26.09.2026).
 *
 * The files are stored publicly under uploads/ so that the settings page
 * can play them; there is nothing secret about them.
